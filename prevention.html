                        There’s a vaccine to prevent Ebola, but it is not availabvle in the U.S. The best way to avoid catching the disease is by not traveling to areas where the virus is found. 
                        
                        If you are in areas where Ebola is present, avoid contact with bats, monkeys, chimpanzees, and gorillas since these animals spread Ebola to people. You may be able to get the vaccine from the World Health Organization.
                        
                        Health care workers can prevent infection by wearing masks, gloves, and goggles whenever they come into contact with people who may have Ebola.

                    Frequently wash your hands with soap and water for at least 20 seconds. <br> 
                    When soap and running water are unavailable, use an alcohol-based hand rub with at least 60% alcohol.
                    <br>
                    Always wash hands that are visibly soiled. <br>
