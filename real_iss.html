                    <h2>Ebola</h2>
                        <p class="text">Ebola is a rare but deadly virus that causes fever, body aches, and diarrhea, and sometimes bleeding inside and outside the body.

                            As the virus spreads through the body, it damages the immune system and organs. Ultimately, it causes levels of blood-clotting cells to drop. This leads to severe, uncontrollable bleeding.
                            
                            The disease was known as Ebola hemorrhagic fever but is now referred to as Ebola virus.
                            
                            It kills up to 90% of people who are infected.</p>

                    <h3>HIV</h3>
                    <p class="text">HIV stands for human immunodeficiency virus. It weakens a person’s immune system 
                        by destroying important cells that fight disease and infection. No effective cure exists for HIV. 
                        But with proper medical care, HIV can be controlled. You can get or transmit HIV only through specific activities. 
                        Most commonly, people get or transmit HIV through sexual behaviors and needle or syringe use.

                        Only certain body fluids—blood, semen, pre-seminal fluid, rectal fluids, 
                        vaginal fluids, and breast milk—from a person who has HIV can transmit HIV. These fluids 
                        must come in contact with a mucous membrane or damaged tissue or be directly injected into 
                        the bloodstream (from a needle or syringe) for transmission to occur.</p>

                   <h4>COVID-19 (Coronavirus disease 2019 ) </h4> 
                   <p class="text">Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), also known as 2019-nCoV acute respiratory disease, 
                       is an infectious disease caused by SARS-CoV-2, a virus closely related to the SARS virus. The disease 
                       is the cause of the 2019–20 coronavirus outbreak.It is primarily spread between people via respiratory 
                       droplets from infected individuals when they cough or sneeze.Time from exposure to onset of symptoms 
                       is generally between 2 and 14 days. Spread can be limited by handwashing and good hygiene.</p>
